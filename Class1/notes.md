//Datatypes  in js
Data types is an attributes associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its value.
In datatype we use "typeof" operator to know that ,what kind of data we want to used.
-Basiacally there are two types of datatypes are there:

1:Primitive Datatype

-In js there are 7 types of primitive datatypes are there.
  1.Number-It stores numerical value
  2.String-stores characters or word
  3.Boolean-True or false
  4.Undefind-Not defined any value 
  5.Null-store nothing
  6.BigInt-Big interger value , above this value :-(-999999999 - +999999999)
  7.Symbol-symbol give a unique value

  2-Reference datatypes or Non-primitive datatypes
    - in js there are 3 types of non primitive datatypes are there
    1.Function-Instead of doing the same task again and again we use function ,
      ---------- it enhance the code reusability 
                - if we want any changes then it easy to to change in function
              syntax: function functionNmae(){

                //code to be executed 
              }
              //function call
              functionName()

    2.Array:In js array stores different type of data as well as similar type of datatypes
        -let arrayName = [element1, element2, element3];
        - let arr=[1, " anjan" ,"Ranjan",11]

    3.Object-object is reference type of datatype where we cans tore more then one element in a single frame
            - mainly object are working on "key value" pair
            -let student={
              name:"Anjan",
              roll:11,
              age:22,
              dist:"Balasore"
            };

    here object name is student
    and name ,roll,age,dist are the keys
    and "Anjan",11,22,"Baasore" are values



    //Operator
      -Operator are the key features to do some task or operate some class
      -Ex:a+b
      - in the above example a and b are the operands and  "+ " is the operator
      -In js five types of operator are there 
        1.Arithmatic OP..(+,-,*,/,%,**)
        2.Assignment OP..(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,)
        3.Comparisional Op..(==, ===,)
        4.Logical OP(And(&&),Or(||),logical not(!))
        5.Unary Op(increment ++ ,decrement --)
